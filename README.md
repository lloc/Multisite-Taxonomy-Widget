Multisite Taxonomy Widget
=========================

Display a **recent posts**-widget of all your posts in your 
blog-network which have a specific tag, category or any other 
built-in or custom taxonomy.

_Please keep in mind that the version of the Multisite Language Switcher at GitHub is a work in progress._

**Download the [latest stable from the WordPress Plugin Directory](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/multisite-taxonomy-widget.zip).**

Need help? Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/lloc/Multisite-Taxonomy-Widget/wiki) first! If you find any bugs then I would very much like to [hear about the issue](https://github.com/lloc/Multisite-Taxonomy-Widget/issues).

How to use the widget
---------------------

After the activation of the plugin you'll find a new widget called Multisite Taxonomy in _Appearance > Widgets_ (/wp-admin/widgets.php).

When you dragged the widget in one of your sidebars you can fill in various parameters for customizing the output:

1.  Title
2.  Taxonomy
3.  Name
4.  Limit
5.  Thumbnail
